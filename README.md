# Orbital-Simulation
This code was written for the ME512 class to create a constellation of GPS sattelites surrounding the moon. The code provided results and figures that could be later used for presentation purposes.

## This code covers
The main things we consider are:
 - Coverage of the moon
 - Number of sattelites used
 - Peturbations
 - Sun Angles
 - Moon blocking the sun
 - Earth blocking the sun
 - Ground link back to Glasgow
 - Impulse transfers from LEO to all the orbits
 - The $\Delta$ V required for this
 
## Credts
This code was developed by @eldonkerino, @Ahrenman1, and Myself. This fork is just to provide a obvious record on my own page, for anyone that is interested. 

Mhy main contributions were in the ground link calculations, some of the algebra for the ground coverage, and the dV and mass calculations.
